\section{Performance Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we present the performance impact of the live deployment of
\xxx. We deployed \xxx on a MacBookPro9,2, which has the Intel Core i5-3210M CPU
with 2 cores and 4 thread, 10GB DDR3 memory and a 1T SSD. The tracing tool is
running in the background 24X7. Once the spinning cursor appears on the screen,
we store the tracing data for root cause analysis.

As we use the ring buffer to collect events, the space cost for disk is fixed
to the configured size 2G by default, and the memory used to collect tracing
items are fixed to 512M by Apple internal, so the memory overhead is pretty low
with regards to the memory usage of modern applications. We measure the the CPU
overhead and XXXXX of \xxx by running benchmarks in our machine with the tracing disabled and
enabled respectively, which we name them bare\_run and tracing\_run.

\paragraph{iBench}
\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c}
\hline
 & 1st & 2nd & 3rd & 4th & 5th\\
\hline
 bare run & 5.98 & 6.23 & 6.18 & 6.05 & 6.28\\
\hline
 tracing run& 6.29 & 6.01 & 6.09 & 6.28 & 6.01\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Score From iBench}
\label{tab:ibench}
\end{table}

We first show the five runs of iBench for both cases. The machine is
clean booted for each run. The scores are quite close as shown in
Table\ref{tab:ibench}..

\paragraph{TPC-C}
Next, we evaluation the throughput with tpc-c on \xxx.

\paragraph{Chromium Benchmark}
We also perform the evaluation on benchmark of Chromium, while recording the
time usage. The telemetry from Chromium project is used to measure the CPU
overhead of \xxx. In the experiment, it uses the chromium to launch webpage and
scroll over. The result is shown in Table~\ref{tab:chromium benchmark}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
\hline
 & bare run & tracing run \\
\hline
real & 27.7s & 28.0s \\
\hline
user & 28.3s & 28.3s \\
\hline
sys &  5.0s & 5.7s\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Chromium benchmark: telemetry}
\label{tab:chromium benchmark}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Conclusion}
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:chromium benchmark}, the overhead for real, user and
sys are 1\%, 0\% and 14\% respectively.
