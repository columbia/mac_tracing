TeXstudio~\cite{texstudio} is an integrated writing environment for creating
LaTeX documents from github. We noticed a user reported bug when he modified his
bib file, the TexStudio hanged for mimutes. The issue was closed by author for
incomplete information to reproduce. We reproduced the bug with a large bib file
editing and collected the data. With the file opened in a tab, every time we
touched the bib file through other editor, vim for example, it shows a spinning
beachball on the window.

\xxx figures out the spinning node is busy processing. Slicing the path from the
busy node, \xxx reaches the daemon ``\vv{fseventd}'' and figures out the busy
processing invoked by the callback function from the daemon. The advantage of
\xxx over other debugging tools is it helps to narrow down the root cause with
the path. If the user reported the infomation with \xxx, it should have provided
the author more hints to reproduce the bug successfully.

%%Another operation triggering spinning beachball in TeXstudio is pasting
%%a large amount of context in any file. The spinning node is busy with
%%\textit{QEditor::insertFromMimeData(QMimeData const*)}, which always invokes
%%\textit{match(QNFAMatchContext*, QChar const*, int, QNFAMatchNotifier)}. Path
%%slicing by \xxx attributes it to the user's keyboard inputs of cmd+v. The
%%problematic code resides where developers copy data from the pasteboard.
