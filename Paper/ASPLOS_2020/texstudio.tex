TeXstudio~\cite{texstudio} is an integrated writing environment for creating
LaTeX documents from github. We noticed a user reported spinning cursor when he
modified his bib file. Although the issue was closed by the developer, due to insufficient
information to reproduce the bug, we reproduced it with a large bib file opened in
a tab. Each time we touched the file through another editor, vim for example, the
application window showed a spinning cursor.

\xxx figures out the \spinningnode is busy processing. Slicing the path from
the vertex, \xxx reaches the daemon ``\vv{fseventd}'' and figures out that the long-running function
is invoked by a callback function from this daemon. The advantage of
\xxx over other debugging tools is it helps to narrow down the root cause with
the path. If the user's bug report had included details captured with \xxx, it may have provided
the developer with enough information to reproduce the bug successfully.

%%Another operation triggering spinning cursor in TeXstudio is pasting
%%a large amount of context in any file. The \spinningnode is busy with
%%\textit{QEditor::insertFromMimeData(QMimeData const*)}, which always invokes
%%\textit{match(QNFAMatchContext*, QChar const*, int, QNFAMatchNotifier)}. Path
%%slicing by \xxx attributes it to the user's keyboard inputs of cmd+v. The
%%problematic code resides where developers copy data from the pasteboard.
