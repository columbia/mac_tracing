TeXstudio~\cite{texstudio} is an integrated writing environment for creating
LaTeX documents from github. We noticed a user reported spinning cursor when he
modified his bib file. Alghough the issue was closed by author for incomplete
information to reproduce, we reproduced the bug with a large bib file opened in
a tab. Each time we touched the file through other editor, vim for example, the
application window shows a spinning cursor.

\xxx figures out the \spinningnode is busy processing. Slicing the path from
the vertex, \xxx reaches the daemon ``\vv{fseventd}'' and figures out the busy
processing is invoked by the callback function from the daemon. The advantage of
\xxx over other debugging tools is it helps to narrow down the root cause with
the path. If the user reported the infomation with \xxx, it should have provided
the author more hints to reproduce the bug successfully.

%%Another operation triggering spinning cursor in TeXstudio is pasting
%%a large amount of context in any file. The \spinningnode is busy with
%%\textit{QEditor::insertFromMimeData(QMimeData const*)}, which always invokes
%%\textit{match(QNFAMatchContext*, QChar const*, int, QNFAMatchNotifier)}. Path
%%slicing by \xxx attributes it to the user's keyboard inputs of cmd+v. The
%%problematic code resides where developers copy data from the pasteboard.
