\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:casestudy}

In this section, we demonstrate how \xxx helps to diagnose \nbug spinning-cursor
cases in \napps popular applications. Table~\ref{table:bugs-desc} describes
these spinning-cursor cases, which are detailed in the sections that follow.
We compared \xxx with traditional causual tracing methods~\cite{XXXX} on edges
and vertices \xxx mitigated, and studied the ratios of over-connection filted
with message peers heuristic. and connection added by data flags and wait
hueristics to avoid under-connection. User interactions are critical in the path
slicing due to the inherent inaccurate in the graph. Our results shows the user
interaction does not overwhelm the debugging process while makes the debugging
much more efficient. Table~\ref{table:results} demonstrates our results with the
length of path sliced with \xxx, which is much shorter than the one generated
automatically by heuristically choosing the most recent edges if multiple
predecessors.

%Bug 0-Apple is ...... The spinning cursor is created when the main thread
%stops responding to events for two seconds. Every application has an
%NSEvent thread, which coordinates with WindowsServer to display a spinning
%cursor when necessary. Two data flags ``\vv{is\_mainthread\_spinning}'' and
%``\vv{dispatch\_to\_mainthread}'' are involved.
