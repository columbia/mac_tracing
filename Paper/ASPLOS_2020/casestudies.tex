\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:casestudy}

In this section, we presents how we apply \xxx to examine spinning beachballs
in \nbug popular applications. We begin with how we found out the design of
spinning beachball in Apple with event graph. Then we describe the cases in
three categories corresponding to \textbf{B1 - B3} in \S~\ref{sec:overview}.
Since chromium case has discussed in (\S\ref{sec:overview}), it will not
be present in this section.
