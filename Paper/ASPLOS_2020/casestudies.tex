\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:casestudy}

In this section, we demonstrate how \xxx helps to diagnose \nbug spinning-cursor
cases in \napps popular applications. Table~\ref{table:bugs-desc} describes
these spinning-cursor cases, which are detailed in the sections that follow.
We compared \xxx with traditional causual tracing methods~\cite{XXXX} on edges
and vertices \xxx mitigated, and studied the ratios of vertices divided by
with message peers heuristically to reduce over-connection, and edges added
by both data flags and wait event inside a block to avoid under-connection.
User interactions are critical in the path slicing due to the inherent
inaccurate in the graph. Our results shows the user interaction does not
overwhelm the debugging process while makes the debugging much more efficient.
Table~\ref{table:results} demonstrates our results with the length of path
sliced with \xxx, which is much shorter than the one generated automatically by
heuristically choosing the most recent edges if multiple predecessors.

%Bug 0-Apple is ...... The spinning cursor is created when the main thread
%stops responding to events for two seconds. Every application has an
%NSEvent thread, which coordinates with WindowsServer to display a spinning
%cursor when necessary. Two data flags ``\vv{is\_mainthread\_spinning}'' and
%``\vv{dispatch\_to\_mainthread}'' are involved.
