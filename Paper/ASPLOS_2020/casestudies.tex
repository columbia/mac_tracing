\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:casestudy}

In this section, we demonstrate how \xxx helps to diagnose \nbug spinning-cursor
cases in popular applications. Table~\ref{table:bugs-desc} describes these
spinning-cursor cases, which are detailed in sections that follow. We compared
\xxx with traditional causal tracing methods on edges and vertices mitigated.
The portions of over-connection filtered out and incognito under-connections
disclosed are studied. Even with our technique, the filtered graph remains
too inaccurate for automatic causal tracing. Fortunately, user interactions
compensate the inaccuracy in causal path slicing, while not overwhelming in the
diagnosis process.

Our results in Table~\ref{table:results} show the portion of connections
filtered with heuristics is limited. User interaction is still required for
diagnosis, but in most cases, up to 3 user queries suffice to find root cause
path accurately. Although a complex application like 8-MSWord and 1-Chromium
requires 22 and 13 queries respectively, many of them results from repeated
patterns. They can be easily identified by users, as discussed below. Our
interactively path slicing exclude much noise, and are shorter and easier to
inspect.

Overall, in the case of simple text editing applications, \xxx can identify the
UI event that causes a spinning cursor by merely relying on a few heuristics.
However, these heuristics may make the wrong decision in complicated cases, and
misidentify the relationships between intra/inter-thread events. It is unlikely
that there exists a single graph search method that works in all cases, e.g.
when given the choice between multiple incoming edges, the most recent match is
sometimes correct, but sometimes not. This is why our system relies on expert
knowledge of users to reconstruct a developer's intent and accurately diagnose
performance issues.

\paragraph{How \xxx Detects Spinning Cursors}

When the spinning cursor shows up, a hang reporting tool, \spindump usually
kicks in automatically to sample callstacks for debugging. To figure out the
\spinningnode in the main thread, we turn to the event graph, and slice path
backward from the launch of \spindump.
The path shows that \spindump is launched after receiving a message from
\vv{WindowServer}, which received a message from the \vv{NSEvent} thread of
the freezing app. The call stack attached to the messages further reveals the
\vv{NSEvent} thread fetches \vv{CoreGraphics} events from
\vv{WindowServer}, converts and creates NSApp events for the main 
thread. If the main thread fails to process an NSApp event before the timer
fires, \vv{NSEvent} thread sends a message to \vv{WindowServer} via the API
``\vv{CGSConnectionSetSpinning}'' from the timer handler, and \vv{WindowServer}
notifies the \vv{CoreGraphics} to draw a spinning cursor over the application
window. To avoid sending more events to an already-spinning main thread, 
the NSApp thread uses two data flags to track the main thread status, 
\vv{is\_mainthread\_spinning} and \vv{dispatch\_to\_mainthread}.
These flags are also modified by the main thread to update its status.
\xxx leverages this API to identify the \spinningnode in the main thread.

%Bug 0-Apple is ...... The spinning cursor is created when the main thread
%stops responding to events for two seconds. Every application has an
%NSEvent thread, which coordinates with WindowsServer to display a spinning
%cursor when necessary. Two data flags ``\vv{is\_mainthread\_spinning}'' and
%``\vv{dispatch\_to\_mainthread}'' are involved.
