\subsection{Installer}

As we were told, any spinning beachball in MacOS indicated a bug. In some
situation, the ``\vv{bugs}'' confuse users. Installer is one of the case. When
Installer pops up a window for previleged permission during the installation of
\texttt{jdk-7u80-macosx-x64}, moving the cursor out of the popup window triggers
spinning beachball.

\xxx collected 550M data for Installer, and generated a graph with
392199 edges and 294856 vertexes. It figuree out the main thread is
blocked in the API \textit{[IFRunnerProxy\ requestKeyForRights:askUser:]},
which sent a synchronous XPC to daemon \textit{authd} with
\textit{xpc\_connection\_send\_messag\_with\_reply\_sync}. In conclusion, if the
user does not focus on the popup window, it will be treated as a main thread
non-responsive bug.
