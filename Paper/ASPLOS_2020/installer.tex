When Installer pops up a window for privileged permission during the
installation of \texttt{jdk-7u80-macosx-x64}, moving the cursor out of the popup
window triggers spinning beachball. Examing the spinning node reported by \xxx, it is easy to figure out the main
thread blocks in \textit{[IFRunnerProxy\ requestKeyForRights:askUser:]}. The
function sends a synchronous message to daemon \textit{authd}. The root cause
is the authentication of user's previledge synchronously in the main thread,
instead of the handler for moving cursor.
