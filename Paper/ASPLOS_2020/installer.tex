Installer is an application included in macOS that extracts and installs
files out of \vv{.pkg} packages. When \vv{Installer} pops up a window for
privileged permission during the installation of \vv{jdk-7u80-macosx-x64},
moving the cursor out of the popup window triggers spinning cursor.

As we put in the password directly before the round of triggering the
spinning cusor, \xxx successfully records the baseline scenario. Examing
the \spinningnode and its \similarnode, \xxx figures out the daemon
\vv{authd} blocks on semaphore. The blocking synchronous authentication
of user's previledge in the main thread (user stops input) is the root
casue, instead of the cursor moving handler. The result was verified with
\v{lldb}. The main thread sends a synchromous message via \vv{[IFRunnerProxy\
requestKeyForRights:askUser:]} to authd.


We also discovered a communication pattern in \vv{Installer} underpinning the
crucial of interactive debugging. It involves four vertices in four threads,
vertex $Vertex_{main}$ in the main thread, and $Vertex_1$ to $Vertex_3$ in
three worker threads. First, the main thread wakes up three worker threads.
Then one worker thread is scheduled to run. At its end, another worker thread,
which waits on mutex lock, is woken in $Vertex_2$, which in turn wakes up the
next worker thread in $Vertex_3$. While \xxx is slicing backward, $Vertex_3$
has two incoming edges: one is from $Vertex_{main}$, and the other one is from
$Vertex_2$. Since users can peek the edges before making decision, they are
likely to figure out that the three worker threads contend with mutex lock, and
all of them are the heirs of $Vertex_{main}$.
