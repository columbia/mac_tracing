\begin{itemize}

\item case study and implementation part [done]
	\begin{enumerate}
 	\item 1.add how to find similar node [done]
 	\item 2.diagram to explain the root caused for the longwait and repeatedyield. design a legend for threads, processes, running vs waiting, message, wait-wakeup, key ops(set a flg) [no space for diagram]
	\item 3.table for case study case. [done]
		1)rate of nodes divided by msg heuristics,
		2)rate of nodes merged by wait in block heuristics,
		3)path length of baseline slicing interactively compared to traditional automatic way: point-action is critical but not that burdon
        4)#interaction

	\end{enumerate}

\item overview [done]
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item legend for the diagram as it contains both code and dynamic concepts such as thread vs processes, messages, running and wait,etc [done]
    \item add reference to figures in the text[done]
	\end{enumerate}


\item reference
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item papers that discuss bugs in distributed systems or multithreaded programs
	\end{enumerate}

\item writing-typos-consistent [done]
	\begin{enumerate}
	\time command, variable names, etc should have \vv [done]
	\item spinning beachballs->spinning-cursor [done]
	\item nodes->vertex/vertices [done]
	\item share\_data...->data flag[done]
	\end{enumerate}

\item casestudies
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item tables on bug description [done]
	\item tables on quantative data [done]
	\item diagrams for cases [no space]
