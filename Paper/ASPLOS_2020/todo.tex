\begin{itemize}
\item case study and implementation part
	\begin{enumerate}
 	\item 1.add how to find similar node in implementation part: remove from interactive , with nearest node heuristic
 	\item 2.diagram to explain the root caused for the longwait and repeatedyield. design a legend for threads, processes, running vs waiting, message, wait-wakeup, key ops(set a flg)
	\item 3.table for case study case. 
		1)rate of nodes divided by msg heuristics,
		2)rate of nodes collapsed by wait in block heuristics,
		3)path length of baseline slicing interactively compared to traditional automatic way: point-action is critical but not that burdon
