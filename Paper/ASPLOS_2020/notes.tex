\subsection{Notes}

Notes is a note-taking app developed by Apple. We encounter spinning beachball
in the app on a relatively long note. Although it works well when the note is
generated and stored, the spinning beachball appears when we try to launch Notes
the next time. It prevent us from accessing the note for over one hour.

With the collected tracing data, \xxx reports Notes is busy with
\textit{NSDetectScrollDevicesThenInvokeOnMainQueue}.
