Sequel Pro~\cite{SequelPro} is a fast, easy-to-use Mac database management
application for working with MySQL databases. It allows user to connect to
database with a standard way, socket or ssh.

We experienced the non-responsiveness of Sequel Pro while its network connection
got lost and it tried re-connections. The tracing data collected by \xxx
contains 1) a quick network connection during login, and 2) Sequel Pro lost
connection for a while. Although \xxx identified the \spinningnode and
corresponding (baseline) \similarnode with ease, it can hardly get the correct
causal path in the baseline scenario without a user's interaction. The backward
slicing on vertex, which has multiple incomming edges, including one from
kernel thread, makes it hard to rely on heuristics. Our interactively search is
extremely helpful in the step, greatly reducing the noise in the path. Close
examine of the \spinningnode based on the causual path tells that the main
thread is waiting for the kernel thread, which in turn waits for the ssh thread.

%\xxx helps to filter out overconnetions by dividing XXX combined batching node
%with hueristics, and recovers XXX missing edges due to the shared flag. In the
%diagnosis process, we get XXX similar node, XXX times of queries on backward
%slicing , XXX vertices for inspect.

Existing debugging tools like \vv{lldb} and \vv{spindump} could hardly figure
out the root cause, in that both of them diagnose with only call stacks, missing
the dependency across process boundaries.
