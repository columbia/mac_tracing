Sequel Pro is a fast, easy-to-use Mac database management application for
working with MySQL databases. It allows user to connect to database with a
standard way, socket or ssh. We noticed spinning cursors while the network
connection was lost and Sequel Pro tried re-connections.

We collected tracing data in two cases: 1) network connected quickly when we
login, and 2) Sequel Pro lost connection for a while. \xxx first identifies the
\spinningnode from SequelPro's main thread and \xxx gets a similar vertex in the
baseline scenario(case 1)), and slices path backwards. With the threads in the
baseline, \xxx searches them by turns to find the missing edge to \spinningnode
The close examination tells that the main thread is waiting for the kernel
thread, which in turn waits for the ssh thread.

%\xxx helps to filter out overconnetions by dividing XXX combined batching node
%with hueristics, and recovers XXX missing edges due to the shared flag. In the
%diagnosis process, we get XXX similar node, XXX times of queries on backward
%slicing , XXX vertices for inspect.

Existing debugging tools like \vv{lldb} and \vv{spindump} could hardly figure
out the root cause, in that both of them diagnose with only call stacks, which
miss the dependency across process boundaries.
