Sequel Pro is a fast, easy-to-use Mac database management application for
working with MySQL databases. It allows user to connect to database with a
standard way, socket or ssh. We noticed spinning cursors while the network
connection was lost and Sequel Pro tried re-connections.

We collected tracing data in two cases: 1) network connected quickly when we
login, and 2) Sequel Pro lost connection for a while. \xxx first identifies the
\spinningnode from SequelPro's main thread. With the Algorithm FindSimilarNode,
\xxx gets a baseline node($N_1$) in case 1). From there, \xxx goes along the
weak edge, from wait event to wake\_up event, to figure out the vertex missing
in case 2), and slices path backwards from the node($N_1$). \xxx carries out
the comparison of the vertices in the thread after the normal vertex gets waken and
before the spinning cursor shows up. The close examination tells that the
main thread is waiting for the kernel thread, which in turn waits for the ssh
thread.

%\xxx helps to filter out overconnetions by dividing XXX combined batching node
%with hueristics, and recovers XXX missing edges due to the shared flag. In the
%diagnosis process, we get XXX similar node, XXX times of queries on backward
%slicing , XXX vertices for inspect.

%Such result could hardly figure out by lldb or
%spindump as both of them only focus on the call stack snapshot for each process,
%instead of providing the connections based the execution history system wide.
