\item{brief description}
\item{advantage over lldb/spindump}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item For blocking or loop yield, it does not provide the baseline case for root cause identification
	\item For busy processing case, it does not provid the User input event or Apple event.
	\end{enumerate}
\item{advantage over traditional causal tracing}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Traditional causal tracing tries to get user transaction from end to end.
		** edges introduced by daemons, leading to other applications involved
			how many other applications' thread will involved in the graph
	\item Traditional causual tracing does not process the case of interrupt,
		will miss the related subgraph.
		** how many edges/nodes missing
	\end{enumerate}
%threads involved? how many edges missing?
\item{user interaction required in the process}
\item{verification of the root cause}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Blocking Cases}
In this section, we discuss the cases where the spinning node is blocking on Wait event.
\begin{itemize}
\item sequelpro <- ssh connection
\item textstudio <- synchronization once the file get touched %recheck data if it can trace back to vim (vim->fsevent->textstudio)
\item installer <- user input blocked
\end{itemize}

%%\input{sequelpro}
%%\input{texstudio}
%%\input{installer}

\subsection{Yielding Loop Cases}
\begin{itemize}
\item system preferences <-branches on a shared variable, add monitor on the variable
	\begin{itemize}
		\item find similar node: compare proceeding nodes, differential metrics
		\item shared variable and script to find out why they have different branches
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CPU Busy Cases}
\begin{itemize}
\item  a table on case description, corresponding root cause reported by Argus
	\begin{itemize}
	\item notes
	\item textedit
	\item mswords
	\item sublimetext
	\item textmate
	\item coteditor
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%%\input{notes}
%%\input{textedit}
%%\input{msword}
%%\input{sublimetext}
%%\input{textmate}
