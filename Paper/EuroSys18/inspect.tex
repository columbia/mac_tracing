We implemented the inspector with two concerns.
The first one is the over-connection.
To eliminate the over connection, the inspector will traverse the dependency graph to find the possible paths that connects any two processes.
If any path of two processes only connects via daemons like WindowServer, they are reported as the suspicious over-connection.
In most cases, at least one of the processes is noise introduced by WindowServer.
In our studies, we found this is because WinsowServer will broadcast certain events and wake up a bunch of processes in the system inside one execution segment.
The daemon fontd will also connects two unrelated processes because of dispatch\_mig\_server, which serves multiple processes continously in a while loop by listensing to a particular port.

The second concern is on the under-connection.
Base on the general sequences of user input processing, we will check the dependency graph to see if the path includes nodes stands for user input, event processing and screen updates complete.
As we use user input as the root of the dependency graph, it is always present.
Updates can be checked via the traced events which represent the display of CALayer objects.
