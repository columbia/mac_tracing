%Dependancy graph generation
Unlike AppInsight which tracks the begin and end of function calls, like edge triggered tracing, we only track particular events and attributes in the states, which is level triggered tracing. 
As worker threads can be reused on behalf of different user inputs or processsing different requests from various applications in the system concurrently,
identifying the execution boundaries is important.
In addition to the known events that can indicated the boundaries, some potential boundaries may be covered by the unknown programming paradigms.
