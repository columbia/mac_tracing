We deployed \xxx Mac OS X x86 platform, with the Model code MacBookPro9,2.  The
model has the Intel Core i5-3210M CPU with 2 cores and 4 thread, 10GB DDR3
memory, and we replace the hard disk with a 1T ssd.  The tracing tool is
running in the background 24X7.  Once the spinning cursor appeers on the
screen, we store the tracing data for the root cause analysis.

In previous section, we studied the real-world softwares, including TextEdit,
Notes, CodEdit in the category of content editing softwares, Installer, System
Preference of the system operation category Hopper Disassembler, Squel Pro and
Chromium of the productive softwares, TextEdit, Notes, Installer and System
Preferences are distributed by Apple.

%our tools, as well as the interactive actions required to figure out the
%concise root causes.  At the end, we also summarize the tedious work that our
Our tool can take over most burden searching and comparing work from the user,
and make the diagnosis much easier in the wild.

In this section we presents the performance impact of the live deployment of Argus.
As we use the ring buffer to collect events, the storage cost can be adjusted
and fixed to 2G in our experiments.
