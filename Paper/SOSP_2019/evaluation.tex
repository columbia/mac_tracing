\section{Evaluation}
We first presents the results from the live deployment of Argus.
We list the softwares which trigger spinning wait cursors in MacOs and the root cause we figure out with our framework.
%TextEdit, Notes, Installer, Hopper Dissembler, ...
Then, we show how much work our tools take over from the user and make the diagnosis much easier in the wild.

\begin{itemize}
\item tracing overhead
\item number of edges and nodes in the graphs.
\item portions of data the user need to examine to figure out the root cause.
\end{itemize}
