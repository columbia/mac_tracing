\subsection{CotEditor}

Different from other text editing softwares, CotEditor does not trigger spinning
beachball while copying a large amount of context. Although paste operation
causes the spinning, the path slicing attributes it to the insertion of a
new line. The main thread is busy on processing \textit{-[NSBigMutableString
characterAtIndex:]} and \textit{CFStorageGetValueAtIndex} in the callstacks.
They are invoked after the user hits the return key to insert a line.

Most of the text editing cases fall into the category of thread busy processing.
Although sampling with lldb can also figure out the most frequently called APIs,
\xxx provides the path slicing over the execution history and can connect them
to the application events, such as user inputs, daemon notifications and so on.
