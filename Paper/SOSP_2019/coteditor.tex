\subsection{CotEditor}

As is TextMate, CotEditor does not trigger spinning beachball when a large
amount of context is copied in the Application.  Any insertion in a large file
results in a spinning beachball.  We collected 318MB trace data and generated a
graph with 374,577 edges and 245,638 vertexes.  The main thread is busy
processing \textit{-[NSBigMutableString characterAtIndex:]} and
\textit{CFStorageGetValueAtIndex}, The processing happens once the return key
is pressed.
