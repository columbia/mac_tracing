\section{Design} \label{sec:design}

\begin{itemize}
    \item record system state (userspace + kernel)
    \item iteratively hone in on the problem
    \begin{itemize}
        \item thread relationships (improve linkage between logs)
        \item find shared variables (pthread mutexes, and manually)
        \item add new trace points for callstacks
    \end{itemize}
    \item find two distinct states (good, and buggy)
    \item verify root cause by adjusting timeout values
    \item patch the problem (in source, runtime, or at binary level)
\end{itemize}
