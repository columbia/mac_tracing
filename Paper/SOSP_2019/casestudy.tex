\section{Case Studies}
We apply our tools to two realworld bugs.
Both of them are long listed in public.
The chromium bug has been reported multiple times in the chromium bug report.
It is essentially a deadlock bug.
Timeout was added and it turned out a livelock bug.
Cache mechanism is added to alieviate but not solve it ultimately.
The bug of the System Preferences is exposed by an app called DisableMonitor.
Basiclly the app can change some system settings and eventually reveal the inappropriate displayer management
in the Core Graphics.
