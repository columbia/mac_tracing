\subsection{Notes}
The Notes spinning cursor is quite annoying in the fact that one wrote an note
and stored it, and later when she tried to lauch the Notes app, the spinning
beachball appeared for a long while. It prevents the user from accessing the
note for over one hour in our experiment.

With \xxx we stop the recording in 3 minutes after the spinning
cursor shows up, and collect the trace of 229M.
The generated graph has 198228 edges and 144051 notes.
It reports within one second by searching the graph that
the node which peforms the block submited by
\textit{NSDetectScrollDevicesThenInvokeOnMainQueue}.
