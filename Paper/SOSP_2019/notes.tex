\subsection{Notes}
The Notes spinning cursor is quite annoying in the fact that
one wrote an note and stored it, and later when she tried to
lauch the Notes app, the spinning beachball showd for a long
while. It prevents user to check the note for over one hours
in our experiment.

With \xxx we stop the recording in 3 minutes after the spinning
cursor shows up, and collect the trace of 229M.
The generated graph has 198228 edges and 144051 notes.
It reports within one second by searching the graph that
the node which peforms the block submited by
\textit{NSDetectScrollDevicesThenInvokeOnMainQueue}.
