\section{Conclusion}
Our key insight in this paper is that causal tracing is inherently
imprecise. We have reported patterns we observed that pose big precision
challenges to causal tracing, and built \xxx, a practical system for
effectively debugging performance issues in MacOS applications despite the
imprecision of causal tracing.  To do so, it lets a user provide domain
knowledge interactively on demand. Our results show that \xxx effectively
helped us locate all root causes of the issues, including a bug in Chromium,
 and incurred only 1\% CPU
overhead in its system-wide tracing.
