Althought many efforts are made to eliminate performance bugs,
optimizations in both software and hardware,
they still exist every computing platforms. 
Spinning beachball is an indicator used to imply performance bugs in Mac.
However, debugging in such cases are still hard.
The user should know where the app gets stuck and what exactly causes the hanging(root cause).
Using lldb to reproduce such bug is impossible due to the high latency caused by the tool.
It hard to tell if the showing beach ball indicates a performance bug or not.
Moreover, multiple processing and multiple threading are common used in current system.
The root cause of the hanging is not straitforward.
The long latency in the UI thread may caused by a worker thread in the App, event due to the wait on daemons. 
We proposed XXX which leverage the trace tool by Apple to monitor system wide events 24X7.
After collecting the data we analyze and tell the user where the stuck redides.
With the confined range, XXX also provide tools to further execute a conditional debugging.
