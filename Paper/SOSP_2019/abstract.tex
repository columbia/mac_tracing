Confusing behaviors are everywhere in GUI Apps, which is annoying.
Spinning beachball is one of the examples from macOS to stop the user's input.
Unveil the mystery of its design is hard due to the closed source and it is even hardly to figure out which process we should query.
A tool to understand the complex behavior of GUI applications is essential for a third party user, who is neither a system expert nor the developer of the GUI app, to aid debugging, compile concise bug report, or even come up a temporary binary patch.
Argus is the framework where system-wide activity is recorded when the mystery occurs on macOS, and further analysis tools can be built upon to explain the behavior. 
It monitors the system with low-overhead instrumentation running 24X7, from kernel and libraries, constructs the relationship graph with builtin shema to identify different requests executed on threads and correlate them.
Since the captured system activities always contain not only the problematic case but also the normal execution, a comparing tool is provided upon the relationhisp graph to figure out the root cause represented as abnormal control flow.
Hence users can precisely capture the execution path leading to the current system state.
In this paper we describe and study the usage of our Argus framework to reveil root causes for the impenetrable behaviors from realword applications.
