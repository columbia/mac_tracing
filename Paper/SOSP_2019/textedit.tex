\subsection{TextEdit}
The spinning cursor in the content editing softwares are easy to reproduce.
By copying a large amount of text into the system would definitely trigger
the spinning wait cursor.

The size of graph generated by the software is described below.
The event log size is 335M for TextEdit.
The generated graph contains 158066 edges and 126663 vertexes.

With our offline path slicing algorithm and comparison tool,
\xxx reports the spinning node for user to inspect, as the node is
not blocking.
With our light weight callstack, we find out in the node,
TextEdit is busy processing on \textit{get\_vImage\_converter}
and \textit{get\_full\_conversion\_code\_fragment} in the UI thread.
It results from the API \textit{[NSTextView(NSPasteboard)\ \_writeRTFDInRanges:toPasteboard:]}.
