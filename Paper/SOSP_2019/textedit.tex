\subsection{TextEdit}

Select, copy, paste, delete, insert and save are common operations for Mac
users who do text editing. However, these operations on a large amount of
context usually trigger spinning cursors on text editing softwares, including
TextEdit developed by Apple. We traced data from six popular text editing
softwares. including TextEdit, Microsoft Word, SublimeText, TextMate, CotEditor
and TeXStudio. \xxx analyzed the tracing data and reported the spinning node for
users to inspect. All of the cases are fell into the non-blocking categories.
Our lightweight callstack tells the root cause directly.

For the selection in TextEdit, \xxx reports the main thread is busy
processing \textit{[NSBigMutableString\ getCharacters:range:]},
\textit{CFStringGetRangeOfCharacterClusterAtIndex},
\textit{\_CFStringInlineBufferGetComposedRange} and
\textit{NSFastFillAllGlyphHolesForCharacterRange}. All of them are related to
the storage of characters.

For the operation of copy, \xxx reports that TextEdit
is busy with \textit{get\_vImage\_converter} and
\textit{get\_full\_conversion\_code\_fragment} in its main thread.
Both of them are called by \textit{[NSTextView(NSPasteboard)\
\_writeRTFDInRanges:toPasteboard:]}.

In the case of paste in TextEdit, it is busy with
\textit{DDLookupTableRefLookupCurrentWord\_block\_invoke\_2},
\textit{\_RTFGetToken} and \textit{platform\_memmove}. All of them called by
\textit{-[NSTextView(NSPasteboard)\ \_readSelectionFromPasteboard:types:]}
