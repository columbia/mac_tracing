\subsection{SublimeText}

We collected 1.16GB trace data for copy in SublimeText. It generates 173,071
edges and 127,488 vertexes.  While the cursor is spinning, the main thread of
SublimeText is busy encoding characters with \textit{\_\_CFToUTF8Len}.  They
are called from \textit{CFPasteboardSetData}, which invokded by
\textit{px\_copy\_to\_clipboard} in SublimeText source code.

Paste operation in SublimeText also results in the unresponsiveness of UI
thread.  The size of the tracing data is 505MB. The graph consists of 760,003
edges and 535,106 vertexes.  The main thread is busy processing
\textit{decode\_utf8}, \textit{convert\_utf8\_to\_utf32}, string
\textit{append} and \textit{platform\_memmove}.  All are called from
\textit{px\_copy\_from\_clipboard}.

Deleting large context in SublimeText also causes spinning beachball.  Tracing
file for it is 447MB, which contains 789,400 edges and 626,629 vertexes.  The
