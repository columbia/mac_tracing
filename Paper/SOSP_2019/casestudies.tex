\section{Case Studies}                                                                                                       
We apply our tools to study the design of spinning cursors in MacOS, and analyze real-world bugs.                            
We illustrate two of the bugs in this section and leave more cases in section \ref{section:evaluation}.                  
%TextEdit                                                                                                                   
%Load Hopper file                                                                                                           
%Launch of printer                                                                                                          
Both of them are longlisted in public.                                                                                     
The chromium bug has been reported multiple times in the chromium bug report.                                               
It is initially a deadlock bug.                                                                                           
Timeout was added, and it turned to a livelock bug.                                                                         
Cache mechanism is added to alleviate but not solve it ultimately.                                                          
The bug of the System Preferences is exposed by an app called DisableMonitor.                                               
The app can change some system settings and eventually reveal the inappropriate displayer management in the Core Graphics.
