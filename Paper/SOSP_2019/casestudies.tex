\section{Case Studies} \label{sec:casestudy}
We apply our tools to study the design of spinning cursors in MacOS and analyze real-world bugs.
We illustrate two of the bugs in this section and leave more cases in section \ref{section:evaluation}.
Both of them are longlisted in public.

The chromium bug has been reported multiple times in the chromium bug report.
It was initially a deadlock bug in which the main thread in the browser is waiting on a condition variable.
As no one knows how the deadlock triggered, timeout is added as a programming trick to eliminate the deadlock.
However, the bug is not resolved, and the main thread would always timeout in some situation for a relatively long time.
Hence, a further patch introduced cache mechanism to alleviate the non-responsive, which did not solve the problem from the root cause and the main thread still get hang from time to time.

The bug of the System Preferences is exposed by an app called DisableMonitor.
The app can change some system settings and eventually reveal the inappropriate displayer management in CoreGraphics Framework.
