We applied our tool to figure out the desgin of spinning wait cursor in MacOS,
and illustrated the root causes for two cases who triggered the spinning wait cursor.

%The chromium bug has been reported multiple times in the chromium bug report.
%It was initially a deadlock bug in which the main thread in the browser is waiting on a condition variable.
%As no one knows how the deadlock triggered, timeout is added as a programming trick to eliminate the deadlock.
%However, the bug is not resolved, and the main thread would always timeout in some situation for a relatively long time.
%Hence, a further patch introduced cache mechanism to alleviate the non-responsive, which did not solve the problem from the root cause and the main thread still get hang from time to time.

%The bug of the System Preferences is exposed by an app called DisableMonitor.
%The app can change some system settings and eventually reveal the inappropriate displayer management in CoreGraphics Framework.
