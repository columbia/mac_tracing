\subsection{Installer}

As we were told the any spinning beachball in MacOS indicated a bug, in some
situation, the ``\v{bugs}'' confuse users who concern. Installer is one of the
case while poping up a window for previleged permission during the installation
of \texttt{jdk-7u80-macosx-x64}. Moving the cursor out of the popup window
triggers spinning beachball.

\xxx collected tracing events in log of 550M for Installer, The generated graph
contains 392199 edges and 294856 vertexes. \xxx generate the graph in 168
seconds, and find the spinning node is blocked in the \textit{[IFRunnerProxy\
requestKeyForRights:askUser:]}, which sent a synchronous XPC to daemon
\textit{authd} with \textit{xpc\_connection\_send\_messag\_with\_reply\_sync}.
In conclusion, if the user does not focus on the popup window, it will be
treated as a main thread non-responsive bug.
