\subsection{Installer}
Installer throws out spinning wait cursor in a situation
that confuses the users.
While we were installing \texttt{jdk-7u80-macosx-x64}, the installer
asked for privileged permissions.
Once we move the cursor, it starts spinning whenever the
original application is selected, potentially confusing the user.
