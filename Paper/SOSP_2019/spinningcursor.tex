The spinning wait cursor is a painful sight for Mac users, signifying that the application is non-responsive.
It usually remains for munites, leaving the users at a loss .                    

Argus shreds light on the design of the spinning wait cursor with the backward path slicing.
We begin the path from the node where the spindump, a hang reporting tool, is launched,  
considering the spindump shares the same triggering condition.
%As is shown in Figure \ref{fig:spincursor},
The spindump is launched by the message from WindowServer, after the WindowServe received message from the NSEvent thread of targeted Application.

We further added call stacks for the messages and revealed two shared variables, ``\v{is\_mainthread\_spinning}'' and ``\v{dispatch\_to\_mainthread}'', are critical in the desgin,
The NSEvent thread of the targeted App fetches CoreGraphics events from WindowServer, converts and creates NSEvents for the main thread.
If the mainthread is not spinning with the cleared ``\v{is\_mainthread\_spinning}'', ``\v{dispath\_to\_mainthread}'' is set and a timer is armed.
If the main thread processes the next event before the timer fires, nothing happens and the timer gets re-armed.
Otherwise, NSEvent thread sends a message to WindowServer from the timer,
and WindowServer notifies the CoreGraphics to draw spinning cursor over the application window.
