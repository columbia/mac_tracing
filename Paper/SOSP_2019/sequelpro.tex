\subsection{Sequel Pro}
Sequel Pro is a graphical App for database client end.
It can be connect to database server via different ways, socket, ssh and direct connection.
When one of the window in Sequel Pro tries to reconnect with ssh, a spinning cursor appears and blocks the whole application,
which results in the user can not save work in other windows if the reconnection failed.

We got 2G tracing data and generated graph containing 3,650,832 edges and 2,412,236 vertexes.
The main thread is blocked on rw\_lock.
With the path slicing, we discovered the blocking is eventually caused by waiting on ssh connection, as is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sequelpro_ssh_connection}.
