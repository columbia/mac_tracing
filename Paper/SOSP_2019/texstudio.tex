\subsection{TeXstudio}

TeXstudio is an integrated writing environment for creating LaTeX documents. In
their github we noticed some one reported while he was modifying his bib file,
the TeXstudio hanged for minutes. Although the issue was closed by author for
incomplete information for reproduction, we reproduce it in our machine. With a
relatively large bib file from a LaTex project opened in a tab, once we touch
the bib file through other editors, vim for exmaple, we would have a spinning
beachball on the window.

While the beachball is spinning over the application window, the main thread
is busy with \textit{QDocumentPrivate::indexOF(QDocumentLineHandle const*,
int)}. Slicing the path from the busy node, \xxx tells the busy processing is
invoked by the callback from daemon fseventsd. The advantage of \xxx over other
debugging tools is it helps to narrow down the root cause straigtfully with the
path. If the user reported the bug with \xxx' report, it should have provided
the author more hints to reproduce the bug successfully.

Another operation triggering spinning beachball in TeXstudio is pasting
a large amount of context in any file. The spinning node is busy with
\textit{QEditor::insertFromMimeData(QMimeData const*)}, which always invokes
\textit{match(QNFAMatchContext*, QChar const*, int, QNFAMatchNotifier)}. Path
slicing by \xxx attributes it to the user's keybord inputs of cmd+v. The
developers use the APIs to copy from the pasteboard.
