\subsection{Microsoft Word}

Copying context in Microsoft Word produced 1.14GB trace file, which contained
474,178 edges and 306,171 vertexes.  While the spinning cursor showed up for
the application, the main thread was busy with system calls, \textit{lseek},
\textit{fstat64}, \textit{fcntl} and \textit{read} on the same file,
\textit{\_\_CFStringCreateImmutableFunnel3} and \textit{platform\_memmove} over
2 seconds.  They are on the behalf of \textit{-[NSPasteboard\
\_setData:forType:index:usesPboardTypes:]}.

161,921 edges and 110,680 vertexes.  The spinning node are dominated by
