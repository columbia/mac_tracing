%why we need the tool
%Challenge of debug with current tools
%Difference btw our tool and Magpie, AppInsight.etc
%only lldb: directly apply to the whole execution is too slow
%	 infeasible to run 24X7 to capture the bug log
%only depandancy graph:
%	false positive: timeout(long waiting thread is waken up by timeout, the waker is not the root cause)
%	false negtive: bug can be caused by some missing execution, which would only appear in normal execution
%

%How to conqour the challenges
%trace sysmtem wide, can be added in library and system
%get the relationships of threads from the log
%compare spin and normal case to narrow down the range in log
%apply lldb on a small range of code to unveil root cause

Deadlocks and livelocks are known to be significant challenges in developing distributed systems.
A great deal of work has gone into formal analysis of call graphs to try to identify deadlocks.
In practice, when faced with code that deadlocks or may deadlock, many developers will simply add timeouts to all code that obtains locks,
converting a show-stopping hang into a program that will eventually unfreeze itself.
However, the root cause of the cyclic dependency may go unaddressed, leading to significant user-facing delays in applications.

It is difficult for developers to diagnose livelocks with some debugging tools, \eg performance profiling or debugger single stepping,
because these tools slow the code down and the problem only lasts for a certain period of time.
One solution, explored briefly in this paper, is to increase timeouts on locks within the codebase,
but it is difficult to do this systematically.
Furthermore, the problem often results from interactions between many different applications,
which the user may not have source code for.
