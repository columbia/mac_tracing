%why we need the tool
%Challenge of debug with current tools
%Difference btw our tool and Magpie, AppInsight.etc
%only lldb: directly apply to the whole execution is too slow
%	 infeasible to run 24X7 to capture the bug log
%only depandancy graph:
%	false positive: timeout(long waiting thread is waken up by timeout, the waker is not the root cause)
%	false negtive: bug can be caused by some missing execution, which would only appear in normal execution
%

%How to conqour the challenges
%trace sysmtem wide, can be added in library and system
%get the relationships of threads from the log
%compare spin and normal case to narrow down the range in log
%apply lldb on a small range of code to unveil root cause
