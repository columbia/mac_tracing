\subsection{Diagnosis Effectiveness}\label{sec:casestudy}

In this section, we demonstrate how \xxx helps diagnose \nbug
spinning-cursor cases in popular applications. Table~\ref{table:bugs-desc}
describes the operations we perform on each application that triggers a
spinning cursor.  \xxx successfully helped us find root-cause paths for
all spinning cursors.  As shown in Table~\ref{table:bugs-desc}, at most
three user queries suffices in most cases to find the root cause path
accurately. Although complex applications like Microsoft Word and Chromium
require more queries (13 and 22 respectively), many of them result from
repeated patterns. They can be easily identified by users.

%% Overall, in the case of simple text editing applications, \xxx can identify the
%% UI event that causes a spinning cursor by merely relying on a few heuristics.
%% However, these heuristics may make the wrong decision in complicated cases, and
%% misidentify the relationships between intra/inter-thread events. It is unlikely
%% that there exists a single graph search method that works in all cases, e.g.
%% when given the choice between multiple incoming edges, the most recent match is
%% sometimes correct, but sometimes not. This is why our system relies on expert
%% knowledge of users to reconstruct a developer's intent and accurately diagnose
%% performance issues.
