\subsection{Case Studies}\label{sec:casestudy}

In this section, we demonstrate how \xxx helps to diagnose \nbug
spinning-cursor cases in popular applications. Table~\ref{table:bugs-desc}
describes these spinning-cursor cases.

In Table~\ref{table:results}, we compare \xxx with Panappticon and list the
portions of over- and under- connections disclosed.
However, the filtered graph remains too inaccurate to automate diagnosis. 
%interactions help the path slicing while not overwhelming in the diagnosis
%process.  Our results in Table~\ref{table:results} show
%Paths sliced by \xxx are shorter and easier to inspect.
The user interaction is still required but not overwhelming. In most cases, up
to 3 user queries suffice to find root cause path accurately. Although complex
applications like MicosoftWord and Chromium require more queries, 13 and 22
respectively, many of them result from repeated patterns. They can be easily
identified by users.

Overall, in the case of simple text editing applications, \xxx can identify the
UI event that causes a spinning cursor by merely relying on a few heuristics.
However, these heuristics may make the wrong decision in complicated cases, and
misidentify the relationships between intra/inter-thread events. It is unlikely
that there exists a single graph search method that works in all cases, e.g.
when given the choice between multiple incoming edges, the most recent match is
sometimes correct, but sometimes not. This is why our system relies on expert
knowledge of users to reconstruct a developer's intent and accurately diagnose
performance issues.

\input{bugdesc}

%Bug 0-Apple is ...... The spinning cursor is created when the main thread
%stops responding to events for two seconds. Every application has an
%NSEvent thread, which coordinates with WindowsServer to display a spinning
%cursor when necessary. Two data flags ``\vv{is\_mainthread\_spinning}'' and
%``\vv{dispatch\_to\_mainthread}'' are involved.
