\subsection{Microbenchmark} \label{sec:toystudy}

In this section, we demonstrate the inaccuracy of the request graph extracted
with prior causal tracing systems. We performed three microbenchmarks, listed
in Table~\ref{table:microbenchmarks}. In each microbenchmark, we turn on the
appropriate causal tracing system, launch the application we are testing, \eg
\vv{AppList}, and perform our specified GUI interation. We then terminate the
causal tracing system, and ask it to construct a request graph at the moment we
clicked on a GUI element. We search for a path through the request graph from
the GUI action to a display update, and ensure that the path matches the ground
truth (obtained through manual investigation).

In the \vv{AppList} case, we selected \vv{Sequel Pro} from the list of running
applications, and clicked the \vv{Hide} button to minimize it. Within \xxx's
graph, the ground truth sequence of interprocess communication exists: the
sequence is \vv{WindowServer} user events $\rightarrow$ \vv{appleeventsd}
$\rightarrow$ \vv{launchserviced} $\rightarrow$ \vv{Sequel Pro}. The graph
has 59 vertices include multiple incoming edges that a user might need to
distinguish between. Panappticon's graph is a strictly larger superset; it is
much harder to find the ground truth path because spurious edges are included
in far more than 59 vertices, as is information from unrelated processes.
It contains 20 processes, at least 7 of which are unrelated. 4 of them are
included because \vv{WindowServer} batches event processing as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:batchingineventprocessing}; 3 of them are from kernel task's
batching in timer processing. In addition, 4 UI events (mouse click, mouse move,
system defined, and mouse exit event) passed to \vv{AppList} are present in the
same graph because of batching in runloop blocks~\cite{runloop}. Panappticon
cannot split the batched operations without tracking the flags mentioned earlier
in Figure ~\ref{fig:casharedflag}, A third causal tracing system, AppInsight, is
capable of tracking the boundaries of event handlers; however, we did not run it
because it only tracks events within one application, and would miss events in
all daemons as well as in \vv{Sequel Pro} itself.



%In this study, we chose \vv{Sequel Pro} from the list
%of running applications, and clicked the \vv{Hide}. To find the ground truth
%for the transaction, we manually check the tracing log with extra
%instrumentation in event handler. \vv{AppList} fetches user input events from
%\vv{WindowServer}. The user input event handler invokes \vv{appleeventsd} and
%\vv{launchserviced}, which communicate with the chosen app \vv{Sequel Pro}.
%\vv{Sequel Pro} hides itself and \vv{AppList} updates main window. During the
%process, \vv{AppList} invokes daemons like \vv{cfprefsd}, \vv{distnoted},
%\vv{fseventsd}, \vv{syslogd}, \vv{systemstatsd} to communicate with system.

%The graph generated with Panappticon contains more information than
%what we identified. It has 20 processes involved. We identify at least
%7 of them are unrelated to the app. 4 of them are connected because
%of the \vv{WindowServer}'s batching in event processing as shown in
%Figure~\ref{fig:batchingineventprocessing}, and 3 of them are from kernel task's
%batching in timer processing. In addition, 4 UI events(mouse click, mouse move,
%system defined, and mouse exit event) passed to \vv{AppList} are present in the
%same graph because of batching in runloop blocks~\cite{runloop}. All the UI
%updates are batching in a callout function from the runloop. Without tracking
%the flags in Figure ~\ref{fig:casharedflag}, Panappticon can not seperate them.

%Without the Apple developers' efforts, \xxx's binary instrumentation on runloop
%is also not enough to identify all under- and over-connections, therefore our
%event graph exposes 59 vertices with multiple incoming edges.
