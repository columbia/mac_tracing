1. toyapp analyze
2. background section graph
    draw the normal case of chromium in background section to show what causal tracing is
3. overview section graphs
    overview -- simplified the graph with the normal graph
    chromium case -- with horizon bars to show communications among applications
4. case study section table

=================================
Rearch Question
	1. Argus pinpoint root cause? how much manual efforts needed?
	2. How Argus compared to existing tracing tools. Panappticon, AppInsight (algorithm) 
	3. Performance
