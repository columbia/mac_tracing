\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

Our key insight in this paper is that causal tracing is inherently inaccurate.
The inaccuracy is unlikely remidied by heuristics so as to generate a feasible
request graph for automatic performance issue diagnosis. We built \xxx, a
practical system for effectively debugging performance issues despite inaccurate
causal tracing. It lets a user provide domain knowledge on demand to mitigate
the inaccuracy. Compared to all upfront knowledge, this method is more general
and efficient given the various programing paradigms.

%Our results show that \xxx effectively
%helped us locate all root causes of the issues, including a bug in Chromium,
%01 and incurred \cpuoverhead CPU overhead overall in its system-wide tracing.
