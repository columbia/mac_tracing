\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

Our key insight in this paper is that causal tracing is inherently inaccurate.
Despite this limitation, all prior works attempt to perform fully automatic analyses.
We built \xxx, a practical system for full-system tracing and which can
effectively diagnose performance issues, despite the inherent inaccuracy of
causal tracing. It lets a user provide domain knowledge on demand to mitigate
the inaccuracy. Our results show that \xxx effectively helped us locate root
causes of many issues, including a bug in Chromium that has been unaddressed for
more than seven years.
