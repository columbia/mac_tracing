\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

Our key insight in this paper is that causal tracing is inherently inaccurate.
Those inaccuracy are unlikly remidied with heuristics to generate an request
graph feasible to automate diagnosis of performance issues. We built \xxx, a
practical system for effectively debugging performance issues despite inaccurate
causal tracing. It lets a user provide domain knowledge interactively on demand
to mitigate the inaccuracy. Compared to all upfront knowledge, this method is
more general and efficient given the various programing paradigms.

%Our results show that \xxx effectively
%helped us locate all root causes of the issues, including a bug in Chromium,
%01 and incurred \cpuoverhead CPU overhead overall in its system-wide tracing.
