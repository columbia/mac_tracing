\subsection{Handling Inaccuracies}

In this section, we discuss how \xxx leverage heuristics to mitigate
over-connections and under-connections.

\subsubsection{Mitigating Over-Connections}\label{subsec:fix-over}

From a high-level, \xxx deals with over-connections by heuristically splitting
an execution segment that appears mixing handling of multiple requests. It adds
weak causal edges between the segments. When a weak edge is encountered during
diagnosis, it queries users to decide whether to follow the weak edge or stop
(\S\ref{sec:overview}).

Specifically, \xxx splits based on three criteria. First, \xxx recognizes a small
set of well-known batch processing patterns such as \vv{dispatch\_mig\_server()}
in \S\ref{sec:inaccuracy} and splits the batch into individual items. Second,
when a wait operation such as \vv{recv()} blocks, \xxx splits the segment at the
entry of the blocking wait. The rationale is that blocking wait is typically
done at the last during one step of event processing. Third, if a segment
communicates to too many peering processes, \xxx splits the segment when the
set of peers differs. Specifically, for each message, \xxx maintains a set
of two peers including (1) the direct sender or receiver of the message and
(2) the beneficiary of the message (macOS allows a process to send or receive
messages on behalf of a third process). \xxx splits when two consecutive message
operations have non-overlapping peer sets.

\subsubsection{Mitigating Under-Connections}\label{subsec:fix-under}

Under-connections are primarily due to data dependencies. Currently \xxx
queries the user to identify the data flags. It is conceivable to leverage
memory protection techniques to infer them automatically, as demonstrated in
previous record-replay work~\cite{king2005debugging, dunlap2008execution}. It
is out of the scope of this paper and we leave it for future work. Currently,
to discover a data flag, the user re-runs the application with \xxx to collect
instruction traces of the concurrent events in both the normal and spinning
cases and detects where the control flow diverges. \xxx exposes register
values for the basic blocks before the divergence and uncovers the address
of the data flag. Once the user identifies a data flag, \xxx traces it using
either binary instrument, such as the \vv{need\_display} flag in CoreAnimation
(\S\ref{sec:inaccuracy}), or with \xxx's watchpoint tool. \xxx add a causal edge
from a write to a data flag to its corresponding read.
