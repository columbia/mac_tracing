\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}

In this section, we describe the design choices in \xxx's event graphs
(\S\ref{subsec:eventgraph}), its work flow (\S\ref{subsec:overflow}), its
diagnosis algorithm (\S\ref{subsec:debug}), an example diagnosis session
on a real Chromium spinning-cursor issue (\S\ref{subsec:chromium}), and
its limitations (\S\ref{subsec:limit}).

\subsection{\xxx Work Flow} \label{subsec:overflow}

\begin{figure}[tb]

    \caption{\xxx Work Flow}
    \label{fig:argus-overview}
\end{figure}

\xxx operates in two stages as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:argus-overview}. In the first stage, its system-wide
tracing tool collects events from \xxx-instrumented libraries and kernel
using a ring buffer and periodically flushes them to disk.  Its overhead
is small, so a user may run this tool continuously during normal usage of
her computer and invoke \xxx to diagnose when a performance issue occurs.
Alternatively, she can run this tool reactively once she experiences an
issue, and reproduce the issue to collect the events for diagnosis.

In the second stage, the user runs \xxx to diagnose in a semi-automated
manner.  \xxx's algorithm constructs an event graph from the traced events
and traverses the graph to search for the root cause of the performance
issue.  Depending on its finding, it queries the user interactively to
resolve ambiguity such as determining which edge \xxx should follow when a
vertex has multiple incoming edges.  The result from this stage is either
the root cause of the performance issue or that \xxx needs more data such
as user annotation of a data flag or call stacks for the system calls that
the application issues.  Such fine-grained data is not captured by default
to reduce tracing overhead.  The user can always go back to the first
stage to gather such data and diagnose again.

\subsection{Diagnosis Algorithm} \label{subsec:debug} \label{subsec:similarvertex}

To initiate diagnosis, \xxx needs a problem vertex in the event graph to
begin with. While its algorithms and techniques apply to general
performance issues, it currently targets spinning cursors -- macOS
displays them when the current application has not processed any UI events
for over two seconds -- because they are quite annoying to users,
especially several of the authors.  The problem vertex is the one in the
application's main thread, the designated UI-handling thread in macOS,
concurrent to the spinning cursor.

\input{ArgusAlgorithm}

Given the event graph and the \spinningnode, \xxx runs
Algorithm~\ref{alg:alg-diagnosis} to pinpoint the root cause.  Specifically,
upon examining what the main thread is actually doing, there are three
potential cases.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{LongRunning} (lines~\ref{a1:longrunning_begin}
		-~\ref{a1:longrunning_end}). The main thread is busy performing lengthy
		CPU operations. This case is the simplest, and \xxx traverses the event
		graph backwards to find a slice originating from the offending UI event
		to the long running CPU operations. This slice is particularly useful for
		further diagnosing the bug. As shown in Function \textit{InteractiveSlice} in
		line~\ref{alg:interslice-line}, \xxx may encounter vertices with multiple
		incoming edges or weak edges that do not reflect causality when traversing
		the graph. It queries the user to resolve them.

	\item \textbf{RepeatedYield} (lines~\ref{a1:repeatedyield_begin}
		-~\ref{a1:repeatedyield_end}). The main thread is in a yield loop, which
		is highly indicative it is waiting on a data flag (\eg, ``while(!done)
		thread\_switch();''). If \xxx cannot find any record of data flags in the
		\spinningnode, it terminates debugging by prompting the user to identify data
		flags and re-trace the application. Here we assume that the performance issue
		reproduces with a reasonable probability because, fortunately, a one-off issue
		that never reproduces is not as annoying as one that occurs frequently. If
		\xxx finds the data flag the \spinningnode is waiting for, it falls through to
		the next case.

	\item \textbf{LongWait} (lines~\ref{a1:longwait_begin}
		-~\ref{a1:longwait_end}). The main thread is in a lengthy blocking wait and
		the wake-up has been missing. \xxx handles this case by finding a normal
		scenario where the wake-up indeed arrives, and then figures out which wake-up
		edge is missing in the spinning scenario along the expected wake-up path.
                Specifically, \xxx first finds a \similarnode to the spinning one based
		on the sequence of events such as system calls in each vertex (more details
                at the end of this subsection). It then traverses backwards from the \similarnode
                to find the normal wake-up path. For each thread in the wake-up path, it examines
                the vertex in the thread right before the time that the \spinningnode waits. If this
                vertex is also problematic (e.g., another LongWait), \xxx appends it to the path of
                \rootcausenodes, and applies
                Function \textit{Diagnose} recursively to diagnose ``the culprit of the culprit.''
                For each such vertex, it queries the user to determine whether to proceed or stop.
                Based on our experience, a few iterations suffice to pinpoint the root cause.
		%the user needs to inspect only a few vertices to find the root cause.

\end{itemize}

Our experience suggests that the first case is the most common, but the
second and third represent more severe bugs. Long-running CPU operations
tend to be more straightforward to diagnose with existing tools such as
\spindump except they do not connect CPU operations back to daemons and UI
events. Repeated yielding or long waiting cases involve multiple threads
and processes, and are extremely hard to understand and fix even for the
application's original developers.  Such issues may remain unresolved for
years, significantly degrading user experience.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:alg-diagnosis} is semi-automated, integrating user
input to leverage hypotheses or expert knowledge as to why a hang may
occur. Our results show that user inputs, albeit few, are crucial
(\S\ref{sec:casestudy}).

\para{Finding \similarnodes.} \xxx finds \similarnodes to the spinning one
as follows. It computes a signature based on the event sequence in each
vertex. For each system call, it extracts the system call name, key
parameters, and the call stack. If the same system call repeats, \xxx
extracts only one avoid treating vertices as dissimilar simply due to
nonessential factors (e.g., variable number of \vv{write()} calls due to
different data sizes).  It extracts return values, too, except for wait
operations because the difference between a normal node and a spinning one
might just be the return value of a wait operation.  If \xxx finds
multiple \similarnodes, \xxx usually chooses the most recent one
heuristically.

\subsection{Chromium Spinning Cursor Example} \label{subsec:chromium}

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\footnotesize
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./figures/chromium_case_study_1.png}
    \caption{Chromium Spinning Cursor Example. For clarity, only processes are
shown, not their threads.}
    \label{fig:chromium-case-study}
\end{figure}

One of the authors experienced first-hand performance issue
in the Chromium browser. She tried to type in
the Chromium search box a non-English word with a default Input Method Editor
shipped with MacOS. The browser appeared frozen and the spinning cursor showed
for a few seconds. Afterwards everything went back to normal. This issue is
reproducible and always ruins her experience, but is quite challenging to
diagnose because two applications Chromium and IME and many daemons ran and
exchanged messages. It was reported by other users for other non-English input
methods, too.

To diagnose this issue with \xxx, the author follows the steps in
Figure~\ref{fig:argus-overview}. She started system-wide tracing, and then
reproduced the spinning cursor with a non-English search string while the
page was loading. After the very first few characters which the browser
handles normally, the remaining characters triggered a spinning cursor. The
entire session took roughly five minutes. She then ran \xxx to construct
the event graph. The graph was highly complex, with 2,749,628 vertices and
3,606,657 edges, almost fully connected. It spanned across 17 applications;
109 daemons including \vv{fontd}, \vv{mdworker}, \vv{nsurlsessiond} and
helper tools by applications; 126 processes; 679 threads, and 829,287
messages. Given the scale of the graph and the diverse communication patterns,
it would be extremely challenging for prior automated causal tracing
tools~\cite{aguilera2003performance, zhang2013panappticon, attariyan2012x,
cohen2004correlating} because they handle a limited set of patterns. Tools
that require manual schema~\cite{barham2004using, reynolds2006pip}, would be
prohibitive because developers would have to provide schema for all involved
applications and daemons.

Next she ran \xxx to find the \spinningnode in the main thread of the browser
process. \xxx returned a \vv{LongWait} event, a \vv{psynch\_cv\_wait()} with a
timeout of 1.5 seconds, and identified a \similarnode in normal scenario where
the \vv{wait} was signaled quickly.

\xxx then found the normal wake-up path with interactive path slicing,
which connects five threads. The \vv{browser} main thread was signaled
by a \vv{browser} worker thread, which received IPC from a worker thread
of \vv{renderer} where the rendering view and WebKit code run. This
worker thread is woken up by the \vv{renderer} main thread, which in
turn woken by \vv{fontd}, the font service daemon, as shown in the upper
side of Figure~\ref{fig:chromium-case-study}. \xxx further compared
the normal case with the spinning case thread by thread as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:chromium-case-study}, and returned the \vv{LongWait} event on
semaphore in the \vv{renderer} main thread, the culprit that delayed waking up
the \vv{browser} main thread over four seconds. What caused the wait in the
\vv{renderer} main thread though? She thus continued diagnosis and recursively
applied \xxx to the wait in \vv{renderer}(corresponding normal path is not shown
in the figure), and it turned out that \vv{renderer} was actually waiting for
the \vv{browser} main thread -- a circular wait formed.

Inspect of the reported vertices reveals that the \vv{browser} was waiting
for the \vv{renderer} to return the string bounding box for a string, and the
\vv{renderer} was waiting for the \vv{browser} to help render JavaScript.
This circular wait was broken by a timeout in the browser main thread (the
\vv{wait} on \vv{psynch\_cv\_wait()} timeouts in 1,500 ms). While the system
was able to make progress, the next key press caused the spinning cursor to
display for another 1,500 ms. The timeout essentially converted a deadlock
into a livelock. To verify this diagnosis, we shortened the timeout in the
\vv{psynch\_cv\_wait()} called in the Chromium browser to 150 ms, which
proportionally reduced how often this spinning cursor occurs.

\subsection{Limitations} \label{subsec:limit}

\xxx is designed to support technical users or developers for interactive
diagnosis of performance issues.  It is not for ordinary users without
programming expertise.

\xxx may require that a performance issue be reproducible so it can
capture fine-grained event traces including data flag accesses and call
stacks.  Fortunately, a performance issue that never reproduces is
probably not as annoying as one that occurs now and then.  Changing
tracing granularity may perturb timing, causing some
timing-nondeterministic issues to disappear.  However, performance issues
tend to last a while for them to be problematic, and we have not
experienced such nondeterminism in our evaluation.

To diagnose spinning cursors caused other than long running CPU
operations, \xxx requires a normal case to compare against.  This
requirement should generally be fine because if the application always
causes a spinning cursor, the issue is most likely already caught during
testing.

We implemented \xxx in the closed-source macOS which presents a harsh test,
but have not ported \xxx to other operating systems yet. It is possible
that the techniques do not generalize to other operating systems. However,
modern operating systems share many similarities, and inspire each others'
designs, so we are hopeful that the ideas are generally applicable.

%Similarly, the applications and performance issues used in our evaluation may
%be non-representative. We strive to cover a diverse set of common applications
%ranging from browsers to text editors.
