\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}

In this section, we first describe \xxx event graphs
(\S\ref{subsec:eventgraph}). Then we explains how \xxx identifies the vertex
corresponding to the performance anomaly (\S\ref{subsec:indicator}). In the
following section(\S\ref{subsec:overflow}), we describe how \xxx diagnoses
performance issue interactively with a concrete example.

In this section, we describe the steps a user takes to investigate a performance
anomaly with \xxx. Figure~\ref{fig:argus-overview} shows \xxx's work flow with
an example of a user investigating a performance problem in Chromium. The
system wide tracing tool, which collects data from \xxx instrumented library
and kernel, generates logs. They are transformed into an \emph{event graph}
in \xxx's graph construction component. Diagnosis and inference are performed
within this graph, in a semi-automated fashion: \xxx performs searches to trace
logical events as they flow through the system, and it judicially queries
the user for guidance. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:argus-overview}, the \xxx
interactive debugger asks the user to choose one edge in a subgraph. With this
type of interaction, \xxx runs its diagnosis algorithm and reports the root
cause vertices. In the example, the root cause is two vertices which form a
circular wait deadlock across multiple threads. Next, we describe how \xxx
assists the user to diagnose a performance issue.

\subsubsection{Diagnosis with Graph}\label{subsec:debug}

\input{ArgusAlgorithm}

Consider a common performance bug on macOS, the \emph{spinning cursor}, which
indicates the current application's main thread has not processed any UI
events for over two seconds. To initialize debugging a spinning cursor, \xxx
first constructs an event graph from the system-wide event log recorded. It
then queries the event graph to find the ongoing event in the application's
main thread concurrent to the display of the spinning cursor. Given the event
graph and the \spinningnode, \xxx runs Algorithm~\ref{alg:alg-diagnosis} to
interactively pinpoint the root cause.

Specifically, upon examining what the main thread is actually doing, there
are three potential cases.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{LongRunning} (lines~\ref{a1:longrunning_begin}
		-~\ref{a1:longrunning_end}). The main thread is busy performing lengthy
		CPU operations. This case is the simplest, and \xxx traverses the event
		graph backwards to find a slice originating from the offending UI event
		to the long running CPU operations. This slice is particularly useful for
		further diagnosing the bug. As shown in Function \textit{InteractiveSlicing} in
		line~\ref{alg:interslice-line}, \xxx may encounter vertices with multiple
		incoming edges or weak edges that may not reflect causality when traversing
		the graph. It queries the user to resolve them.

	\item \textbf{RepeatedYield} (lines~\ref{a1:repeatedyield_begin}
		-~\ref{a1:repeatedyield_end}). The main thread is in a yield loop, which
		is highly indicative it is waiting on a data flag (\eg, ``while(!done)
		thread\_switch();''). If \xxx cannot find any record of data flags in the
		\spinningnode, it terminates debugging by prompting the user to identify data
		flags and re-trace the application. Here we assume that the performance issue
		reproduces with a reasonable probability because, fortunately, a one-off issue
		that never reproduces is not as annoying as one that occurs frequently. If
		\xxx finds the data flag the \spinningnode is waiting for, it falls through to
		the next case.

	\item \textbf{LongWait} (lines~\ref{a1:longwait_begin}
		-~\ref{a1:longwait_end}). The main thread is in a lengthy blocking wait and
		the wake-up has been missing. \xxx handles this case by finding a normal
		scenario where the wake-up indeed arrives, and then figures out which wake-up
		edge is missing in the spinning scenario along the expected wake-up path.
		Specifically, \xxx first finds a \similarnode to the spinning one based %solely
		on the semantic events such as system calls in each vertex. It then traverses
		backwards from the \similarnode to find the normal wake-up path. For each
		thread in the wake-up path, it examines the vertex in the thread right before
		the \spinningnode waits. If this vertex is also abnormal, \xxx appends it
		to the path of \rootcausenodes, and applies Function \textit{Diagnose} recursively
		to diagnose ``the culprit of the culprit.'' For each such vertex, it queries the
		user to determine whether to proceed or stop because based on our experience
		the user needs to inspect only a few vertices to find the root cause.

\end{itemize}
\noindent
Our experience suggests that the first case is the most common, but the
second and third represent more severe bugs. Long-running CPU operations tend to
be more straightforward to diagnose with existing tools such as \spindump except
they do not connect CPU operations back to daemons and UI events. Repeated yielding or
long waiting cases involve multiple threads and processes, and are extremely
hard to understand and fix even for the application's original developers.
Therefore, issues remain unaddressed for years and significantly impact the
user experience. Algorithm~\ref{alg:alg-diagnosis} is semi-automated but can
integrate user input to leverage hypotheses or expert knowledge
as to why a hang may occur. Our results show that user inputs, albeit few, are
crucial in this process (\S\ref{sec:casestudy}).

One of the authors experienced first-hand the aforementioned performance issue
in Chromium, an open-source browser engine that powers Google Chrome and,
starting recently, Microsoft Edge~\cite{chromiumurl}. She tried to type in the
Chromium search box a Chinese word using SCIM, the default Chinese Input Method
Editor that ships with macOS. The browser appeared frozen and the spinning
cursor occurs for a few seconds. Afterwards everything went back to normal.
This issue is reproducible and always ruins her experience, but is quite
challenging to diagnose because two applications Chromium and SCIM and many
daemons ran and exchanged messages. It was reported by other users for
other non-English input methods, too.

% issue, the user followed Figure 1.Figure~\ref{fig:argus-overview}

To diagnose this issue with \xxx, the author follows the steps in
Figure~\ref{fig:argus-overview}. She started system-wide tracing, and then
reproduced the spinning cursor with a Chinese search string while the page was
loading. After the very first few characters which the browser handles normally,
the remaining characters triggered a spinning cursor. The entire session took roughly
five minutes.
She then ran \xxx to construct the event graph. The graph was highly complex,
with 2,749,628 vertices and 3,606,657 edges, almost fully connected. It spanned
across 17 applications; 109 daemons including \vv{fontd}, \vv{mdworker},
\vv{nsurlsessiond} and helper tools by applications; 126 processes; 679
threads, and 829,287 IPC messages. Given the scale of the graph and the diverse
communication patterns, it would be extremely challenging for prior automated
causal tracing tools~\cite{aguilera2003performance, zhang2013panappticon,
attariyan2012x, cohen2004correlating} because they handle a fairly limited
set of patterns. Tools that require manual schema~\cite{barham2004using,
reynolds2006pip}, would be prohibitive because developers would have to provide
schema for all involved applications and daemons.
% Perfect case for \xxx

Next she ran interactive debugger in \xxx to find the \spinningnode in the main
thread of the browser process. \xxx returned a \vv{LongWait} event, a \vv{psynch\_cv\_wait()}
with a timeout of 1.5 seconds.  
\xxx
compares the \spinningnode to \similarnode in normal scenario where the \vv{wait}
was signaled quickly. \xxx reported three, and confirmed with the user which one
she wanted.

% Figure 2....

\xxx then found the normal wake-up path which connects five threads.
The browser main thread was signaled by a browser worker thread, which
received IPC from a worker thread of daemon \vv{renderer} where the rendering view
and WebKit code run. The worker thread is woken up by the \vv{renderer} main
thread, which in turn woken by \vv{fontd}, the font service daemon. \xxx further
compared the normal path with the spinning case, as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:chromium-case-study}, and returned the \vv{LongWait} event
on semaphore in the \vv{renderer} main thread, the culprit that delayed
waking up the browser main thread over four seconds. What caused the wait in the
\vv{renderer} main thread though? She thus continued diagnosis and recursively
applied \xxx to the wait in \vv{renderer}, and it turned out that \vv{renderer} was
actually waiting to be woken up by the browser main thread -- a circular wait formed.

%and got the wake-up path. The culprit
%that delayed the semaphore was the timeouts in the browser's main thread, as the
%blocking edge shown in \vv{path 2} in Figure ~\ref{fig:chromium-case-study}. At
%this point, a circular wait formed.

%To understand what exactly happens in the situation, she inspected the full
%call stacks by \xxx scripts, taking the reported vertices from the renderer and
%the browser as input. Inspection reveals that the \vv{renderer} requested the
%browser's help to render JavaScript and waited for reply with semaphore. 

Inspect of the reported vertices reveals that the browser was waiting for
the \vv{renderer} to return the string bounding box for a string, and the
\vv{renderer} was waiting for the browser to help render JavaScript. This
circular wait was broken by a timeout in the browser main thread (the \vv{wait}
on \vv{pthread\_cond\_timedwait()} timeout was 1,500 ms). While the system was
able to make progress, the next key press caused the spinning cursor to display
for another 1,500 ms. The timeout essentially converted a deadlock into a
livelock.

To verify this diagnosis, we shortened the timeout in the
\vv{pthread\_cond\_timedwait()} called in the Chromium browser to 150
milliseconds, which proportionally reduced how often this spinning cursor
occurs.

\subsection{Limitations}

\xxx is designed to support interactive debugging of performance issues. It
sometimes requires the user to reproduce a performance issue so \xxx can capture
more fine-grained event traces such as accesses to data flags. Fortunately, a
performance issue that almost never reproduces is probably not as annoying as
one that occurs frequently.

We implemented \xxx in the closed-source macOS which presents a harsh test
for \xxx, but we have not ported \xxx to other operating systems yet. It is
possible that the ideas and techniques do not generalize to other operating
systems. However, modern operating systems share many similarities, and inspire
each others' designs, so we are hopeful that the ideas in \xxx are generally
applicable. Similarly, the applications and performance issues used in our
evaluation may be non-representative, though we strive to cover a diverse set of
common applications ranging from browsers to text editors.
