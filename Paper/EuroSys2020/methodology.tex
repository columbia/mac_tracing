\subsection{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}

%%In this section, we first describe how the performance issues are selected for
%%study. Then we compare \xxx to its closest prior system, and describe how we
%%evaluate the manual efforts needed in diagnosis.

Prior work relies on the request graph per transaction to identify bottlenecks
and speculate possible causes. One of them, Panappticon for Android, is
closest to ours in desgin. Their traced events and causality are in a subset
of ours. To demonstrate the inherent inaccuracy of request graph extracted
with Panappticon's causal tracing, we therefore carry out the study in
~\S\ref{sec:toystudy} with microbenchmark, and also measure the effectiveness of
AppInsight's methodology.

In ~\S\ref{sec:casestudy}, we carry out real-world case study with collected
performance issues of popular applications, because they likely represent the
bugs attractive to tech-savvy users. Among the 26 bugs we examined from the
Github reports, most of them are not able to reproduce due to our system version
or insufficient information. We thus decide to focus on 3 bugs reproduced
successfully. 8 additional performance issues are collected from the daily use
applications in the auther's laptop. As a result, we study 11 reproducible
cases.

%Also explain what metrics/outcomes we look for. "whether these tools enable a
%developer to identify root cause of a given performance issues" or "quantify the
%manual effort needed to ..."

Now we describe how we measure the heuristics which \xxx uses to mitigate graph
inaccuracy, and manual effort required in the diagnosis. We first enable tracing
component in our laptop and reproduce the 11 performance isssues. The tracing
data are collected to construct event graphs, which contain vertices with
multi-incoming edges or weak edges. We run the \xxx diagnosis algorithm, and
count how many times we encounter those vertices. In the worst case that we make
a wrong decision, before reaching the end of path slicing, \xxx allows us to
relocate the path to a particular vertex.
