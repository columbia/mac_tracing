\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Today's web and desktop applications are predominantly parallel or
distributed, making performance issues in them extremely difficult to
diagnose because the handling of an external request is often spread across
many threads, processes, and asynchronous contexts instead of in one
sequential execution segment~\cite{harter2012file}. To manually reconstruct
a graph of execution segments for debugging, developers have to sift
through a massive amount of log entries and potentially code of related
application components~\cite{chen2002pinpoint, zhao2016non, xu2009detecting,
nagaraj2012structured, yuan2012conservative}. More often than not, developers
give up and resort to guessing the root cause, producing ``fixes'' that
sometimes make the matter worse. For instance, a bug in the Chrome browser
engine causes a spinning cursor in macOS when a user switches the input
method~\cite{chromiumbugreport}, was first reported in 2012. Developers
attempted to add timeouts to work around the issue. Unfortunately, the bug has
remained open for seven years and the timeouts obscured diagnosis further.

Prior work proposed what we call \emph{Causal tracing}, a powerful technique
to construct request graphs automatically~\cite{reynolds2006pip, fonseca2007x,
benjamin2010dapper, zhang2013panappticon, ravindranath2012appinsight}. It
does so by inferring (1) the beginning and ending boundaries of the execution
segments (vertices in the graph) involved in handling a request; and (2) the
causality between the segments (edges)---how a segment causes others to do
additional handling of the request. Compared to debuggers such as \spindump that
capture only the current system state, causal tracing is effective at aiding
developers to understand complex causal behaviors and pinpoint the root causes
for real-world performance issues.

Prior causal tracing systems all assume certain programming idioms to automate
inference. For instance, if a segment sends a message, signals a condition
variable, or posts a task to a work queue, it wakes up additional execution
segment. Prior systems assume that wake-ups reflect causality. Similarly, they
assume that the execution segment, from the beginning of a callback invocation
to the end, is entirely for handling related work in a request. Unfortunately,
based on our study and experience of building a causal tracing system for macOS,
we find that modern applications violate these assumptions. Hence, the request
graphs computed by causal tracing are inaccurate in several ways.

First, an inferred segment can be larger than the actual event handling segment
due to batch processing. Specifically, for performance, an application or its
underlying frameworks may bundle together work on behalf of multiple requests
with no clear distinguishing boundaries. For instance, WindowServer in macOS
sends a reply for a previous request and receives a message for the current
request using one system call \vv{mach\_msg\_overwrite\_trap}, presumably to
reduce user-kernel crossings. Second, the graphs can miss numerous causal
edges. For instance, consider data dependencies in which the code sets a flag
(\eg, ``\vv{need\_display} = 1'' in macOS animation rendering) and later
queries the flag to process a request further. This pattern is broader than
ad hoc synchronization~\cite{xiong2010ad} because data dependency occurs
even within a single thread (such as the buffer holding the reply in the
preceding WindowServer example). Although the number of these flags may be
small, they often express critical causality, and not tracing them would lead
to many missing edges in the request graph. However, without knowing where
the flags reside in memory, a tool would have to trace all memory operations,
incurring prohibitive overhead and adding many superfluous edges to the request
graph. Third, inferred edges can be superfluous because wake-ups do not
necessarily reflect causality. Consider an \vv{unlock()} operation waking up an
thread waiting in \vv{lock()}. This wake-up can just be happenstance and the
developer's intent is mutual exclusion. However, the two operations can also
enforce a causal order.

We believe that, without fully understanding of application semantics, request
graphs computed by causal tracing are \emph{inherently} inaccurate and both
over- and under-approximate reality. Although developer annotations can help
improve accuracy~\cite{reynolds2006pip, fonseca2007x}, modern applications use
more and more third-party libraries, whose source code is not available. Given
the frequent use of custom synchronizations, work queues, and data flags in
modern applications, it is hopeless to count on manual annotations to ensure
accurate capture of request graphs.

In this work, we present \xxx, a dramatically different approach in the design
space of causal tracing. It is desgined for tech-savvy users who are intersted
in compiling useful bug reports for their daily use applications, whose source
codes are often not available. As opposed to full manual schema upfront for
all involved applications and daemons~\cite{barham2004using, reynolds2006pip,
fonseca2007x}, \xxx calculates an event graph for a duration of the system
execution with both true causal edges and weak ones, and enables users to
provide necessary schematic information on demand in diagnosis. Specifically, it
keeps humans in the loop, as a debugger should rightly do. \xxx queries users a
judicially few times to (1) resolve a few inaccurate edges that represent false
dependencies and (2) identify potential dependency due to data flags.

We implement \xxx in macOS, which is closed-source on its frameworks and many
applications. This closed-srouce environment therefore provides a true test
of \xxx. We address multiple nuances of macOS that complicate causal tracing,
and build a system-wide, low-overhead, always-on tracer. \xxx enables users to
optionally increase the granularity of tracing (\eg, logging call stacks and
instruction streams) by integrating with existing debuggers such as \vv{lldb}.

We evaluate \xxx on \nbug real-world, open spinning-cursor issues in widely
used applications such as Chromium browser engine and macOS System Preferences,
Installer, and Notes. The root causes of all \nbug issues were previously
unknown to us and, to a large extent, the public. Our results show that \xxx is
effective: it helps us non-developers of the applications find all root causes
of the issues, including the Chromium issue that remained open for seven years.
\xxx mostly needs only less than 3 user queries per issue but they are crucial
in aiding diagnosis. \xxx is also lightweight: its systems-wide tracing incurs
only \cpuoverhead CPU overhead overall.

%% consider adding comparison to prior approaches
%% Our techniques effectively removed false and added missing edges in the
%% event graph.  Even with our techniques, the resultant graph remain too

We make the following contributions: 
\begin{enumerate}

\item We demonstrate conceptual realization that causal tracing is inherently
inaccurate, and introduce interactive approach in the design space of causal 
tracing.

\item We build \xxx, performing system-wide tracing in macOS with little
overhead, and handle several macOS trickeries that complicate causal tracing.

\item We use \xxx to diagnose real-world spinning cursors and find root causes for
performance issues that have remained open for years.

\end{enumerate}

This paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:background}, we
introduce the causal tracing and prior works. In Section~\ref{sec:overview},
we present an overview of using \xxx and a Chromium example. In
Section ~\ref{sec:inaccuracy}, we report inherently inaccuracy
patterns observed in macOS , and Section~\ref{sec:implementation}
describes our tracing implementation and tools for user interaction.
Section~\ref{sec:eval} demonstrates the methodology and results from case
studies, as well as performance evaluation. We summarize related work
in Section~\ref{sec:related-work}, and end with conclusion in Section
~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
